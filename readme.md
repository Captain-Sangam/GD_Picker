# Google Drive Folder Mutli Select

A simple project to showcase the Google Drive Picker API. The APP takes you through the Google OAuth Route to get the required permissions </br>

```
These permissions/tokens/keys are not stored in the server or anywhere else.
They are on your local only and not stored anywhere
```

## Setting up your local env

Create a copy of `env.example` as `.env.local` and replace them with the respective keys

- To install dependencies, run `npm install`
- To start the server, run `npm run dev`
